Communication Table
===================

Communication Table located at $FFFF00, 256 bytes in Genesis MAIN RAM.

Section 1: Slots
----------------

Contains configuration about where slots are placed (i.e. cluster #). Takes 32
bytes (meaning that there's support for up to 32 different subprograms, which
is plenty).

$FFFF00     -   Slot 0 (MENU.SCD)
$FFFF01     -   Slot 1 (VANE.SCD)
$FFFF02     -   Slot 2 (BATTLE.SCD)
$FFFF03     -   Slot 3 (GAMEOVER.SCD)
$FFFF04     -   Slot 4 (ENDING.SCD)
...

An out of range value (i.e. "0") means the slot is "empty", and that is taken
in account by the engine. For example, if slot 0 is 0, MAIN.BEX will fire up
VANE.SCD directly.

Section 2: Data interchange
---------------------------

Contains miscellaneous data used/needed by the subprograms, for example:

$FFFF20     -   Next chapter to load (*)
$FFFF21     -   'Special'(**)
$FFFF22     -   Battle data cluster
$FFFF23     -   Command
$FFFF24-25  -   Next address in script
$FFFF26     -   Language modifier
$FFFF27		-	Top of screen
$FFFF28		- 	Show title bar (chars at $FFFEE7-FFFEFF)
$FFFF29		-   Window height
$FFFF2A		-   Menu bottom
$FFFF2B		-	Menu left
$FFFF2C		-	Program slot bound to Button "B"
$FFFF2D		-	Program slot bound to Button "C"
$FFFF2E		-	Program slot bound to Button "START"

$FFFFFF		-	Next cluster!
...

(*) Make a table chapter->base_cluster for maximum flexibility. VANE.SCD will
load base_cluster (image pool) and base_cluster + 1 + language (script).

(**) In Espacio/Tiempo: activates the ecchi mode, can be used for whatever.
